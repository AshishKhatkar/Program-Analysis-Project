The files contained in this folder were generated using the command: "javap -c <filename>.class". These files were only used to help us draw the bytecode by hand, initially.

For the rest of the Project we're using BCEL to generate CGFs and for accessing the bytecode information contained withing the CFG nodes. We're not using the *.class files.
